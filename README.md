# Dating Project
* In this modern day, people are getting busier with their lives. They are not finding time to meet people out of their work area to find romantic partners. Dating apps exist to solve this problem. But most dating apps do not take into account Ethiopian values and culture. There are Ethiopians that are discouraged by these non relatable solutions. There is an unmet gap to fill. This is what motivates us to build the product.

* In this platform, Ethiopians can easily find romantic partners that fit them well. We do this by matching interested people according to their hobbies, religious preferences, age, proximity and other factors. In this way, the system tries to ensure that well fitting partners are able to meet each other easily.
